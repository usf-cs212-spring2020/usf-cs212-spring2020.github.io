If you do not yet have a free Github account, you need to create one:

<https://github.com/join>

When creating an account for this class (including accounts already created), keep in mind:

- Choose a professional username.

- Add information to your profile, including a professional profile photo and brief bio (including your degree and expected graduation date).

You can see the [instructor's profile page](https://github.com/sjengle) for an example. When done with this class, you'll be able to show off your Github profile to potential employers.
