You will be provided template code and unit tests for the homework. Refer to the `TODO` comments in the template code for specifics on what code to fill in or modify for the assignment. When modifying this code, keep in mind the following:

  - **Do not modify any method or class declarations.** For example, you cannot add or remove keywords like `static` or add a `throws` keyword to a method if one was not already included.

  - **Do not modify methods that are already fully defined.** For example, if a method is provided and has no `TODO` comments within the method definition, you may not modify that method.

  - **Do not modify the test code.** This includes any input or output files utilized by the test code.

  - You MAY add additional members, methods, and classes as needed to the code.

  - You MAY add comments to clarify code for yourself. You can add comments to already defined methods if you want.

  - You MAY change a `return` statement in a method with a `TODO` comment as needed. (You may *not* change the return type in the method declaration, however.)

  - Remove the `TODO` comments when you are done. This removes them from the "Tasks" view in Eclipse. If you want to keep the comment around, you can change the text `TODO` to `DONE` instead.

To receive full credit on any homework assignment, you must:

  - **Pass all of the unit tests.** Specifically, you must pass the unit tests when running the `homework` script on the CS lab computers. See the [homework guides](/guides/homework/) for how to run this script. You will not receive full points if you are passing the tests locally on your system, but not on the lab computers.

  - **Commit your work often.** Ideally, you should commit after you complete every `TODO` in the code. For example, if there are 5 `TODO` comments in the code, your repository should have at least 5 commits.

  - **Follow the `TODO` directions.** For example, if the `TODO` comment stated you must use a `HashSet` and your code does not, you will lose points even if you are passing all of the unit tests.

  - **Properly submit your homework on time.** See the [homework guides](/guides/homework/) for details on how to submit homework, and the [course syllabus]({{ "/syllabus.html#homework" | relative_url }}) for the homework late policy.
