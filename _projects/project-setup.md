Below is a quick summary of the one-time setup needed for the project:

1. Visit the [Project 1 Functionality](https://usfca.instructure.com/courses/1590210/assignments/6911862) assignment in Canvas and click the Github Classroom link to setup a repository named `project-username` where `username` is your Github username.

1. Go to the `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE` directory in the Github website interface, and open the issue template. Click the "Edit" button and modify `FULL_NAME` to be your full name, `GITHUB_ORG` to be the Github organization for your class (e.g. `usf-cs212-2020`), `GITHUB_USER` to be your Github username, and then delete the "First-Time Setup" text after reading it. Save your changes.

1. If needed, setup the [Apache OpenNLP](http://opennlp.apache.org/) user library in Eclipse. See the [Adding User Libraries in Eclipse](/guides/eclipse/adding-user-libraries-in-eclipse.html) guide for steps. Make sure to name the library `opennlp-tools` to avoid build path problems.

1. Import the repository as a Java Project in Eclipse. See the [Importing Eclipse Projects from Github](/guides/eclipse/importing-eclipse-projects-from-github.html) guide for steps. This is where you will add your own code for the project.

1. Import the `project-tests` repository at <{{ site.data.info.links.github.link }}/project-tests> as a Java Project in Eclipse. This is where you will find all of the test code and data files. **These two projects must be located in the same parent directory!** For example `repos/project-username` and `repos/project-tests` share the same parent directory `repos`.

1. Verify you can run the `Project1Test.java` set of tests in the "Project Tests" project in Eclipse.

1. Verify you can make, commit, and push changes to `Driver.java` in the "Project" project in Eclipse.

Once setup, you do not need to go through these steps again.
